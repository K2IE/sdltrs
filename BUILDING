To build for Linux:
-------------------

from the src/linux directory, execute:

        make

To build for Win32:
-------------------
sdltrs is designed to be build with MINGW.
The libSDL programming package for Windows is also required.
In the src/win32 directory, edit the Makefile macros LIBS and INCS to
point to the location of the SDL installation.

Then from the src/linux directory, execute:

        make

To build for Mac OS X:
----------------------
The SDL Framework needs to be placed in the src/macosx directory, so
that it is included in the final application.
Then, open the sdltrs.xcodeproj in src/macosx directory with Xcode,
and build from Xcode.
