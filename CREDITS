 sdltrs would not be possible without Tim Mann's wonderful TRS-80, xtrs, upon
 which it is based.  Thanks Tim!!!!  (http://tim-mann.org/trs80.html)

libSDL Team

 Big thanks also go to the libSDL team for creating the great cross platform
 library that makes sdltrs possible!!

I also thank the following people for their help for the items brought over
from xtrs.

 The JV1 and JV3 floppy disk file formats were designed by Jeff Vavasour,
 originally for his MSDOS-based TRS-80 emulators.

 The DMK format was designed by David Keil for his MSDOS-based TRS-80 emulator.

 The hard disk file format was designed by Matthew Reed for his MSDOS-based
 TRS-80 emulators.

 Al Petrofsky and Todd P. Cromwell III supplied font data.

 Roland Gerlach contributed the CP/M import and export programs as well as
 several bug reports and fixes for the emulator itself.

 Ulrich Mueller added the -borderwidth option, improved the -scale option and
 the bitmap font scaling, ported the import, export, and settime
 utilities to Newdos/80, and contributed the HRG1B emulation.

 Branden Robinson supplied the first version of the cassette man page, fixed
 Makefile bugs, translated cassette to the Bourne shell, and implemented
 watchpoints in zbx.
