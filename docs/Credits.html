The JV1 and JV3 floppy disk file formats were designed by Jeff Vavasour, originally
for his MSDOS-based TRS-80 emulators.   <br><br>

The DMK format was designed by David Keil for his MSDOS-based TRS-80 emulator.  <br><br> 

The hard disk file format was designed by Matthew Reed for his MSDOS-based TRS-80
emulators. <br><br>  

Al Petrofsky and Todd P. Cromwell III supplied font data. <br><br>

Roland Gerlach contributed the CP/M import and export programs as well
as several bug reports and fixes for the emulator itself.  <br><br> 

Ulrich Mueller added the -borderwidth option, improved the -scale option and
the bitmap font scaling, ported the import, export, and settime
utilities to Newdos/80, and contributed the HRG1B emulation.   <br><br>

Branden Robinson supplied the first version of the cassette man page, fixed
Makefile bugs, translated cassette to the Bourne shell, and
implemented watchpoints in zbx. <br><br>  

Mark McDougall provided documentation for the Micro Labs Grafyx Solution card.  <br><br> 

Jenz Guenther added the -title option and contributed code to emulate the GENIE (German Model
I clone).   <br><br>

Joe Peterson contributed code to emulate the TimeDate80 and the -emtsafe feature.  <br><br> 

Denis Leconte contributed part of the -scale implementation. <br><br>
