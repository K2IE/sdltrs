sdltrs is built on top of a Z-80 emulator, with added routines to
support keyboard and video I/O through a SDL interface. The hardware
emulation can operate as a TRS-80 Model I, Model III, Model 4, or Model
4P.<br>

<br>

sdltrs supports 48K of RAM in Model I or Model III mode, 128K in Model
4 or Model 4P mode. Floppy disks and hard disks are emulated using
files to store the data; or under Linux only, real floppy drives can be
used.<br>

<br>

A printer is emulated by sending its output to a text file, or under
Mac OS X only a Epson FX-80 emulator that can save to a PDF file. A
serial port is emulated using a host serial port. Cassette I/O is
emulated using files to store the cassette data. Game sound and music
output are also supported. Though the cassette port, through the Model 4
sound option, and through the optional Orchestra-85/90 music
synthesizer card are all emulated. In Model I mode, the HRG1B graphics
card is emulated. In Model III and 4/4P mode, you can select whether
the Radio Shack graphics card or Micro Labs Grafyx Solution is
emulated. There is also a mouse driver for model 4/4P mode. Several
common time-of-day clock cards are emulated on all models. The Alpha
Products joystick is emulated using the numeric keypad, or through a
SDL compatible joystick.<br>

<br>

Because sdltrs emulates the hardware, all known TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P
operating systems should run on it, including all flavors of TRSDOS,
LDOS/LS-DOS, NEWDOS, DOSPLUS, MultiDOS, and TRS-80 CP/M. However, the
emulator also includes some extensions to the standard hardware, and
the special drivers, utilities, and instructions needed for these are
not provided for all operating systems.<br>

<br>

The Z-80 emulator has a debugger called zbx. You can enter the debugger
either by starting sdltrs with the -debug flag or by pressing F9 while
sdltrs is running. The debugger runs in the command line terminal
window that you started sdltrs from, or on the Mac OS X port, from a
separate window. Once you are in the debugger, type "help" for more
information.<br>

<br>

Special support in the emulator allows the program to block when
waiting for information from the keyboard. This will work only for
programs that wait for keyboard input using the standard Model I/III
ROM call; the emulator decides whether to block the Z-80 program when
it tries to read from the keyboard memory by pattern-matching its stack.<br>

In Model III, 4, and 4P modes, the left and right shift keys are
distinct; in Model I mode, they are the same. The keys [, \, ], ^, _, {, |, }, and ~ also activate unused positions
in the keyboard matrix (address bit 3, data bits 3-7). With
many TRS-80 keyboard drivers, these keys map to the corresponding ASCII
characters; with others, they do nothing. In some cases you may find
the shift state is reversed from what it should be; if you press [ but
{ is displayed instead (etc.), see the -shiftbracket and
-noshift-bracket options below to correct the problem. The Insert key
maps to the same position as underscore (address bit 3, data bit 7), so
that this key can be used both with and without shift pressed; with
many TRS-80 keyboard drivers one of these maps to ASCII code 0x7f.<br>

<br>

Pressing a key on a numeric keypad with NumLock disengaged emulate
the Alpha Products joystick. Keys 2, 4, 6, 8
(KP_Down, KP_Left,KP_Right, KP_Up) are the main directions; keys 1, 3,
7, and 9 (KP_End,KP_Page_Down, KP_Home, KP_Page_Up) work as diagonal
directions by activating two main directions at once; and key 0
(KP_Insert) or 5 (KP_Begin) is the fire button. <br>

<br>
In addition to command line options to set the <a href="Options.html">emulator options</a>
(most of which are also settable in the <a href="TextGUI.html">Text GUI</a>
), sdltrs allows the
use of Configuration Files.&nbsp; On Linux, if no
configuration file is specified, it will use (or create if it doesn't
exist) one in the users home directory named
sdltrs.t8c.&nbsp; On Windows, if no
configuration file is specified, it will use (or create if it doesn't
exist) one in the same directory as the executable named
sdltrs.t8c. On Mac OS X, that default configuration is stored in
the standard OS X Preferences for the application.<br>

<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Text_GUI"></a>Text GUI</big></big><br>

<br>
sdltrs provides a Text based menuing system that allows you to most
aspect of emulator operation.&nbsp; The GUI is available at all times
in the Windows and Linux versions, and in Fullscreen mode on the Mac OS
X version (more info on the <a href="TextGUI.html">Text GUI</a>
page).&nbsp; The Text GUI is entered by pressing F7, and exited by
using the ESC key.&nbsp; In the Mac Windowed mode, normal Mac menus and
preferences, in addition to graphical interface called the Media
Manager provides the same functionality (more info on the <a href="OSXFeatures.html">OS X
Features</a> page).&nbsp; A picture of the top level menu of the GUI is below:<br>

To control the emulated cassette, a file for the loaded tape is
controlled by the -cassette option or the cassette option in the menu
system. There is also a menu option to control the cassette position in
the file.

For printer support, any text sent
to the TRS-80's printer (using
LPRINT or LLIST, for example) may be sent to a text file.&nbsp; On Mac
OSX, there is also a full emulation of an Epson FX80 printer available..<br>

In Model I mode, sdltrs emulates a Radio Shack Expansion Interface with
the Percom Doubler or Radio Shack Doubler installed. The Doubler
provides double-density disk access by allowing either the stock WD1771
FDC chip or a WD1791 chip to be selected under program control. At
powerup the 1771 is selected, so operating systems with no Doubler
driver see a stock system. By default, the emulator pretends to be both
a Percom and Radio Shack Doubler at the same time -- it responds to the
special commands of both -- so a driver for either should work. Under
LDOS, use the command "FDUBL" (newer versions of LDOS), or "PDUBL" or
"RDUBL" (older versions) to install the driver. Software that tries to
detect which doubler you have (such as Super Utility) may be confused
by the emulation of both at once, so you can choose to emulate only one
with a command line option or text GUI control (or preference on Mac
OSX)<br>

<br>

In Model III, 4, or 4P mode, sdltrs emulates the stock floppy
controller, which uses a WD1793 chip (software-compatible with the
WD1791) to provide both single and double density.<br>

<br>

Four 5.25-inch floppy drives are emulated. Disk image files may be
inserted into the emulated drives with command line options, text GUI
controls (or menus or Media window on Mac OSX). If the user does not
have write permission for a floppy file, and/or the file has an
internal write protect flag set, a write-protect tab is emulated. Use
the mkdisk(1) program to turn the write protect flag on or off. <br>

<br>

If you try to boot an emulated Model I, III, or 4 with no emulated disk
(that is, no disk in drive 0), sdltrs emulates having no floppy disk
controller. The behavior of a real machine with a disk controller in
this case didn't seem useful to emulate faithfully: A real Model I
hangs with a screen full of garbage; a real Model III or 4 goes into a
retry loop printing "Diskette?" on the screen and rechecking if you've
inserted one. A real Model 4P always has a floppy controller, however,
so sdltrs always emulates one.<br>

<br>

Due to a limitation of the original Model I hardware, drive :3 cannot
be double-sided in Model I mode. In the original Model I, you could not
have a drive :3 at all if any drive in the system was double-sided, but
the emulator is able to be more forgiving.<br>

<br>

Emulated floppy image files can be of any of three types: JV1,
compatible with Jeff Vavasour's popular freeware Model I emulator for
MS-DOS; JV3, a compatible extension of a format first used in
Vavasour's commercial Model III/4 emulator; or DMK, compatible with
David Keil's Model 4 emulator. All threetypes work in sdltrs regardless
of what model it is emulating. A heuristic is used to decide which type
of image is in a drive, as none of the types has a magic number or
signature.<br>

<br>

JV1 supports only single density, single sided, with directory on track
17. Sectors must be 256 bytes long. Use FORMAT (DIR=17) if you want to
format JV1 disks with more (or less) than 35 tracks under LDOS.<br>

<br>

JV3 is much more flexible, though it still does not support everything
the real controllers could do. It is probably best to use JV3 for all
the disk images you create, since it is the most widely implemented by
other emulators, unless you have a special reason to use one of the
others. A JV3 disk can be formatted with 128, 256, 512, or 1024-byte
sectors, 1 or 2 sides, single or double density, with either FB
(normal) or F8 (deleted) data address mark on any sector. In single
density the nonstandard data address marks FA and F9 are also
available. You cannot format a sector with an incorrect track number or
head number. You can format a sector with an intentional CRC error in
the data field. sdltrs supports at most 5802 total sectors on a JV3
image.<br>

<br>

The original Vavasour JV3 format supported only 256-byte sectors, and
had a limit of 2901 total sectors. If you use sector sizes other than
256 bytes or format more than 2901 sectors on a disk image, emulators
other than sdltrs may be unable to read it. Note that an 80 track,
double-sided, double-density (18 sector) 5.25-inch floppy will fit
within the original 2901 sector limit; the extension to 5802 is
primarily for emulation of 8-inch drives (discussed below).<br>

<br>

The DMK format is the most flexible. It supports essentially every
thing that the original hardware could do, including all "protected"
disk formats. However, a few protected disks still may not work with
sdltrs due to limitations in sdltrs's floppy disk controller emulation
rather than limitations of the DMK format; see the LIMITATIONS section
below.<br>

<br>

Blank disks may be created from the Text GUI (or the Media menu on Mac
OSX).<br>

<br>

Early Model I operating systems used an FA data address mark for the
directory on single density disks, while later ones wrote F8 but would
accept either upon reading. The change was needed because FA is a
nonstandard DAM that is fully supported only by the WD1771 floppy disk
controller used in the Model I; the controllers in the Model III and 4
cannot distinguish between FA and FB (which is used for non-directory
sectors) upon reading, and cannot write FA. To deal nicely with this
problem, sdltrs implements the following kludge. On writing in single
density, an F8 data address mark is recorded as FA. On reading with an
emulated WD1771 (available in Model I mode only), FA is returned as FA;
on reading with a WD179x, FA is returned as F8. This trick makes
the different operating systems perfectly compatible with each other,
which is better than
on a real Model I! You can use the -truedam flag to turn off this
kludge if you need to; in that case the original hardware is emulated
exactly.<br>

<br>

TRS-80 programs that attempt to measure the rotational speed of their
floppy disk drives using timing loops will get the answers they expect,
even when sdltrs does not emulate instructions at the same speed as the
original machines. This works because sdltrs keeps a virtual clock
(technically, a T-state counter), which measures how much time it
should have taken to execute the instruction stream on a real machine,
and it ties the emulation of floppy disk index holes to this clock, not
to real time.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Emulated_8-inch_floppy_disks_"></a>Emulated 8-inch floppy disks<br>
</big></big><br>

In addition to the four standard 5.25-inch drives, sdltrs also emulates
four 8-inch floppy drives. There is no widely-accepted standard
hardware interface for 8-inch floppies on the TRS-80, so sdltrs
emulates a pseudo-hardware interface of its own and provides an
LDOS/LS-DOS driver for it.
<br>

<br>

The only difference between 5.25-inch and 8-inch emulated drives is
that the emulator allows you to format more bytes per track in the
latter. A new
JV3 floppy can be formatted as either 5.25-inch or 8-inch depending on
whether you initially put it into a 5.25-inch or 8-inch emulated drive.
A new DMK floppy, however, must be created as an 8 inch image in order
to be large enough for use in an 8-inch emulated drive. JV1 floppies
cannot be used in 8-inch drives. Be careful not to put an emulated
floppy into a 5.25-inch emulated drive after it has been formatted in
an 8-inch emulated drive or vice versa; the results are likely to be
confusing. Consider using different file extensions for the two types;
say, .dsk for 5.25-inch and .8in for 8-inch.<br>

<br>

To use the emulated 8-inch drives, you'll need a driver. Under LDOS or
LS-DOS, use the program XTRS8/DCT supplied on the emulated floppy
utility.dsk. This
driver is a very simple wrapper around the native LDOS/LS-DOS floppy
driver. Here are detailed instructions.<br>

<br>

First, make sure an appropriate version of LDOS is in emulated floppy
drive 0, and the supplied file utility.dsk is in another emulated
floppy drive. Boot LDOS. If you are using Model I LDOS, be sure FDUBL
is running.<br>

<br>

Second, type the following commands. Here d is the LDOS drive number
you want to use for the 8-inch drive and u is the unit number you chose
when naming the file. Most likely you will choose d and u to be equal
to reduce confusion.<br>

<br>

<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEM
(DRIVE=d,DRIVER="XTRS8",ENABLE)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Enter unit number ([4]-7): u</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
</big><br>

You can repeat these steps with different values of d and u to have
more than one 8-inch drive. You might want to repeat four times using
4, 5, 6, and 7, or you might want to save some drive numbers for hard
drives (see below).<br>

<br>

Finally, it's a good idea to give the SYSTEM (SYSGEN) command (Model
I/III) or SYSGEN command (Model 4/4P). This command saves the SYSTEM
settings, so the 8-inch drives will be available again the next time
you reboot or restart the emulator. If you need to access an 8-inch
drive after booting from a disk that hasn't been SYSGENed, simply use
the same SYSTEM command again.<br>

<br>

In case you want to write your own driver for another TRS-80 operating
system, here are details on the emulated pseudo-hardware. The 8-inch
drives are accessed through the normal floppy disk controller, exactly
like 5.25-inch drives. The four 5.25-inch drives have hardware select
codes 1, 2, 4, and 8. The four 8-inch drives have hardware select codes 3, 5,
6, and 7, corresponding respectively to files.
(See also the -sizemap option below, however.)<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Real_floppy_disks_"></a>Real floppy disks<br>
</big></big><br>

NOTE: This is untested with SDLTRS. It worked with the original xtrs
program, however, the SDLTRS author has no way to test or support this
option.<br>

Under Linux only, you can load a real floppy disk drive, typically
/dev/fd0 or /dev/fd1 in one of the emulated drives. Most PCs should be
able to read and write TRS-80 compatible floppies in this way. Many PC
floppy controllers cannot handle single density, however, and some may
have problems even with double density disks written on a real TRS-80,
especially disks formatted by older TRS-80 operating systems. Use the
-doublestep flag if you need to read 35-track or 40-track media in an
80-track drive. If you need to write 35-track or 40-track media in an
80-track drive, bulk-erase the media first and format it in the
80-track drive. Don't write to a disk in an 80-track drive if it has
ever been written to in a 40-track drive. The narrower head used in an
80-track drive cannot erase the full track width written by the head in
a 40-track drive.<br>

<br>

If you load one of the emulated 5.25-inch floppy drives with a real
floppy drive filename, TRS-80 programs will see it as a 5.25-inch
drive, but the actual drive can be either 3.5-inch or 5.25-inch. The
drive will be operated in double density (or single density), not high
density, so be sure to use the appropriate media.<br>

<br>

If you load one of the emulated 8-inch floppy drives with a real floppy
drive, TRS-80 programs will see it as an 8-inch drive. Again, you need
to use the XTRS8/DCT driver described above to enable LDOS/LS-DOS to
access an 8-inch drive. The real drive can be either 3.5-inch,
5.25-inch, or 8-inch. A 3.5-inch or 5.25-inch drive will be operated in
high-density mode, using MFM recording if the TRS-80 is trying to do
double density, FM recording if the TRS-80 is trying to do single
density. In this mode, these drives can hold as much data as a standard
8-inch drive. In fact, a 5.25-inch HD drive holds exactly the same
number of bits per track as an 8-inch drive; a 3.5-inch HD drive can
hold 20% more, but we waste that space when using one to emulate an
8-inch drive. In both cases we also waste the top three tracks, since
an 8-inch drive has only 77 tracks, not 80.<br>

<br>

The nonstandard FA and F9 data address marks available in single
density on a real Model I with the WD1771 controller also need special
handling. A PC-style floppy disk controller can neither read nor write
sectors with such DAMs at all. This raises three issues: (1) It will be
impossible for you to read some Model I disks on your PC even if your
PC otherwise supports single density. In particular, Model I TRSDOS 2.3
directory tracks will be unreadable. (2) On writing in single density,
sdltrs silently records a F9 or FA DAM as F8. (3) On reading in single
density with an emulated WD1771 (Model I mode only), F8
is returned as FA. If you need more accurate behavior, the -truedam
flag will turn on error messages on attempts to write F9 or FA DAMs and
will turn off translation of F8 to FA on reading.<br>

<br>

Hint: Be sure to set the drive type correctly in your PC's BIOS. Linux
and sdltrs rely on this information to know how fast your drives are
spinning and hence what data rate to use when reading and writing. All
3.5-inch drives spin at 300 RPM. Newer 5.25-inch high-density capable
drives ("1.2MB" drives) normally always spin at 360 RPM. (Some can be
jumpered to slow down to 300 RPM when in double-density mode, but you
should not do that when plugging one into a PC.)
Older 5.25-inch drives that cannot do high density ("180KB", "360KB" or
"720KB" 5.25-inch drives) always spin at 300 RPM. All 8-inch drives
spin at 360 RPM. If you plug an 8-inch drive into a PC (this requires a
50-pin to 34-pin adaptor cable), tell your BIOS that it is a 5.25-inch
1.2MB drive.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Emulated_hard_disks_"></a>Emulated hard disks<br>
</big></big><br>

sdltrs can emulate a hard disk in a file in one of two ways: it can use
a special, sdltrs-specific LDOS driver called XTRSHARD/DCT, or it can
emulate the Radio Shack hard drive controller (based on the Western
Digital WD1010) and use the native drivers for the original hardware.
<br>

Using XTRSHARD/DCT<br>

<br>

The XTRSHARD/DCT driver has been tested and works under both LDOS 5.3.1
for Model I or III and TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.3.1 for Model 4/4P. It may or
may not work under earlier LDOS versions. It definitely will not work
under other TRS-80 operating systems or with emulators other than
sdltrs or xtrs. The hard disk format was designed by Matthew Reed for
his Model I/III and Model 4 emulators; sdltrs duplicates the format so
that users can exchange hard drive images across the emulators.<br>

<br>

To use XTRSHARD/DCT, first create a blank hard drive file using the
Text GUI (or menus on Mac OSX).<br>

<br>

Second, load the file into one of the emulated hard drives using a
command line option, the Text GUI, (or menu or Media Window on Mac OSX).<br>

<br>

Third, make sure an appropriate version of LDOS is in emulated floppy
drive 0, and the supplied file utility.dsk is in another emulated
floppy drive. Boot LDOS. If you are using Model I LDOS 5.3.1, patch a
bug in the FORMAT command by typing PATCH FORMAT/CMD.UTILITY M1FOR-
MAT/FIX. You need to apply this patch only once. It must not be applied
to Model III or Model 4/4P LDOS.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

Fourth, type the following commands. Here d is the LDOS drive number
you want to use for the hard drive (a typical choice would be 4) and u
is the unit number you chose when naming the file (most likely 0).<br>

<br>

<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">SYSTEM
(DRIVE=d,DRIVER="XTRSHARD",ENABLE)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Enter unit number ([0]-7): u</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">FORMAT d (DIR=1)</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
</big><br>

Answer the questions asked by FORMAT as you prefer. The DIR=1 parame-
ter to FORMAT is optional; it causes the hard drive's directory to be
on track 1, making the initial size of the image smaller. You can
repeat these steps with different values of d and u to have more than
one hard drive.<br>

<br>

Finally, it's a good idea to give the SYSTEM (SYSGEN) command (Model
I/III) or SYSGEN command (Model 4/4P). This command saves the SYSTEM
settings, so the drive will be available again the next time you reboot
or restart the emulator. If you need to access the hard disk file after
booting from a floppy that hasn't been SYSGENed, simply use the same
SYSTEM command(s) again, but don't FORMAT. You can freely use a
different drive number or (if you renamed the hard disk file) a differ-
ent unit number.<br>

<br>

Technical note: XTRSHARD/DCT is a small Z-80 program that implements
all the required functions of an LDOS disk driver. Instead of talking
to a real (or emulated) hard disk controller, however, it uses special
support in sdltrs that allows Z-80 programs to open, close, read, and
write host files directly. This support is described further in the
"Data import and export" section below.<br>

<br>

<big style="text-decoration: underline;">Using native hard disk drivers<br>
</big><br>

Beginning in version 4.1, sdltrs also emulates the Radio Shack hard
disk controller (based on the Western Digital WD1010) and will work
with the native drivers for this hardware. This emulation uses the same
hard drive (.hdv) file format that XTRSHARD/DCT does. With LDOS/LS-DOS,
the RSHARDx/DCT and TRSHD/DCT drivers are known to work. With Montezuma
CP/M 2.2, the optional Montezuma hard disk drivers are known to work.
The hard disk drivers for NEWDOS/80 and for Radio Shack CP/M 3.0 should
work, but they have not yet been tested at this writing. Any bugs
should be reported.<br>

<br>

First create a blank hard drive file using the Text GUI (or menus on
Mac OSX).<br>

<br>

Second, load the file into one of the emulated hard drives using a
command line option, the Text GUI, (or menu or Media Window on Mac OSX).<br>

<br>

Note that if hard drive unit 0 is loaded on a Model 4P, the Radio Shack
boot ROM will always try to boot from it, even if the operating system
does not support booting from a hard drive. If you have this problem,
either hold down F2 while booting to force the ROM to boot from floppy,
or simply avoid using unit number 0. Stock TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6 systems do
not support booting from a hard drive; M.A.D. Software's HBUILD6 add-on
to LS-DOS for hard drive booting should work, but is untested.
Montezuma CP/M 2.2 does boot from the emulated hard drive.<br>

<br>

Finally, obtain the correct driver for the operating system you will be
using, read its documentation, configure the driver, and format the
drive. Detailed instructions are beyond the scope of this manual page.
<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Data_import_and_export_"></a>Data import and export</big></big><br>

<br>

Several Z-80 programs for data import and export from various TRS-80
operating systems are included with sdltrs on two emulated floppy
images. These programs use special support in the emulator to read and
write external host files, discussed further at the end of this
section<br>

.
<br>

The emulated floppy utility.dsk contains some programs for transferring
data between the emulator and ordinary Unix files. IMPORT/CMD,
IMPORT/BAS, EXPORT/CMD, EXPORT/BAS, and SETTIME/CMD run on the emulator
under Model I/III TRSDOS, Model I/III LDOS, Model I/III Newdos/80, and
Model 4/4P TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6; they may also work under other TRS-80 oper-
ating systems. Model III TRSDOS users will have to use TRSDOS's CONVERT
command to read utility.dsk.
<br>

<br>

IMPORT/CMD imports a host file and writes it to an emulated disk.
<br>

Usage: <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">IMPORT [-ln]
hostfile [trsfile] </span></big><br>

The -n flag converts Unix
newlines (\n) to TRS-80 newlines (\r). The -l flag converts the host
filename to lower case, to compensate for TRS-80 operating systems such
as Newdos/80 that convert all command line arguments to upper case.
When using the -l flag, you can put a [ or up-arrow in front of a
character to keep it in upper case. If the destination file is omitted,
IMPORT uses the last component of the host pathname, but with any "."
changed to "/" to match TRS-80 DOS file extension syntax.<br>

<br>

IMPORT/BAS is a much slower program that performs the same function as
IMPORT/CMD but may work under more operating systems. Simply run it
under Disk Basic and answer the prompts.
<br>

<br>

EXPORT/CMD reads a file from an emulated disk and exports it to a host
file. <br>

Usage: <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">EXPORT [-ln] trsfile
[unixfile]</span></big><br>

The -n flag converts TRS-80 newlines (\r) to Unix newlines (\n). The -l
flag converts the host filename to lower case. When using the -l flag,
you can put a [ or up-arrow in front of a character to keep it in upper
case. If the destination file is omitted, EXPORT uses the TRS-80
filename, but with any "/" changed to "." to match host file extension
syntax.<br>

<br>

EXPORT/BAS is a much slower program that performs the same function as
EXPORT/CMD but may work under more operating systems. Simply run it
under Disk Basic and answer the prompts.<br>

<br>

SETTIME/CMD reads the date and time from the host computer and sets the
TRS-80 DOS's date and time accordingly.<br>

<br>

The next several programs were written in Misosys C and exist in two
versions on utility.dsk. The one whose name ends in "6" runs on Model 4
TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6.x; the other runs on LDOS 5.x and most other Model
I/III operating systems.<br>

<br>

CD/CMD (or CD6/CMD) changes sdltrs's host working directory. Usage: CD
[-l] hostdir. The -l flag converts the host directory name to lower
case. When using the -l flag, you can put a [ or up-arrow in front of a
character to keep it in upper case. Running CD/CMD will change the
interpretation of any relative pathnames given to IMPORT or EXPORT. It
will also change the interpretation of disk names at the next disk
change, unless you specified an absolute pathname for sdltrs's -diskdir
parameter.<br>

<br>

PWD/CMD (or PWD6/CMD) prints sdltrs's host working directory.
<br>

UNIX/CMD (or UNIX6/CMD) runs a host shell command. Usage: UNIX [-l]
host command line. The -l flag converts the Unix command line to lower
case. When using the -l flag, you can put a [ or up-arrow in front of a
character to keep it in upper case. Standard I/O for the command uses
the sdltrs program's standard I/O descriptors; it does not go to the
TRS-80 screen or come from the TRS-80 keyboard.<br>

<br>

MOUNT/CMD (or MOUNT6/CMD) is a convenience program that switches
emulated floppy disks with xtrs. It does not work with sdltrs.<br>

<br>

UMOUNT/CMD (or UMOUNT6/CMD) is a convenience program that removes an
emulated floppy disk with xtrs. It does not work with sdltrs.<br>

<br>

The emulated floppy cpmutil.dsk contains import and export programs for
Montezuma CP/M, written by Roland Gerlach. It was formatted as a
"Montezuma Micro Standard DATA disk (40T, SS, DD, 200K)," with 512-byte
sectors. Be careful to configure your CP/M to the proper disk format
and drive parameters (40 track, not 80), or you will have confusing
problems reading this disk. Source code is included on the floppy;
please pass any improvements you make back to the author. See
http://www.rkga.com.au/~roland/trs-80/cpm-xtrs/, where you will
sometimes find a newer version of the utilities than is included with
sdltrs.<br>

<br>

IMPORT.COM imports a host file and writes it to an emulated CP/M disk.<br>

Usage: <span style="font-family: monospace;"><big>IMPORT [-n]
[hostfile[cpmfile]]</big></span><br>

The -n flag converts Unix
newlines (\n) to CP/M newlines (\r\n). If the second filename is
omitted, it is taken to be the same as the first. If both names are
omitted, the program prompts for filenames. Note that the CP/M CCP
converts all command line arguments to upper case, which is
inconvenient if your Unix file names are in lower case; in that case
you'll need to let the program prompt for the filenames.<br>

<br>

EXPORT.COM reads a file from an emulated CP/M disk and exports it to a
host file. <br>

Usage: <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">EXPORT cpmfile
[$[T][L]] </span></big><br>

The cpmfile name can use ?
and * as wildcard characters. The $T flag converts CP/M newlines (\r\n)
to Unix newlines (\n). The $L flag converts the CP/M filename to
lowercase to form the Unix filename; note that the CP/M CCP converts
all command line arguments to upper case, so you need $L even if you
typed the CP/M name in lower case.<br>

<br>

The emulator implements a set of pseudo-instructions (emulator traps)
that give TRS-80 programs access to Unix files. The programs listed
above use them. If you would like to write your own such programs, the
traps are documented in the file trs_imp_exp.h. Assembler source code
for the existing programs is supplied in sdltrshard.z, import.z,
export.z, and settime.z. You can also write programs that use the traps
in Misosys C, using the files sdltrsemt.h and sdltrsemt.ccc as an
interface; a simple example is in settime.ccc. The Basic programs
import.bas and export.bas should not be used as a basis for further
development, however; they use an old, slow mechanism in the emulator
that may be removed in a future release rather than the emulator traps.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Interrupts_"></a>Interrupts<br>
</big></big><br>

The emulator supports only interrupt mode 1. It will complain if your
program enables interrupts after powerup without executing an IM 1
instructionfirst. All Model I/III/4/4P software does this, as the
built-in peripherals in these machines support only IM 1.<br>

<br>

The Model I has a 40 Hz heartbeat clock interrupt, while the Model III
uses 30 Hz, and the Model 4/4P can run at either 30 Hz or 60 Hz. The
emulator approximates this rather well even on a system where clock
ticks come at some frequency that isn't divisible by the emulated
frequency (e.g., 100 Hz on Intel Linux), as long as the true frequency
is not slower than the emulated frequency. The emulator has a notion of
the absolute time at which each tick is supposed to occur, and it asks
the host system to wake it up at each of those times. The net result is
that some ticks may be late, but there are always the proper number of
ticks per second. For example, running in Model I mode on Intel Linux
you'd see this pattern: (tick, 30ms, tick, 20ms,...) instead of seeing
ticks every 25ms.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Processor_speed_selection_"></a>Processor speed selection<br>
</big></big><br>

A standard Model 4 has a software-controlled switch to select operation
at either 4.05504 MHz (with heartbeat clock at 60 Hz) or 2.02752 MHz
(with heartbeat clock at 30 Hz). sdltrs emulates this feature.
<br>

Model I's were often modified to operate at higher speeds than the
standard 1.77408 MHz. With one common modification, writing a 1 to port
0xFE would double the speed to 3.54816 MHz, while writing a 0 would set
the speed back to normal. The heartbeat clock runs at 40 Hz in either
case. sdltrs emulates this feature as well.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Sound_"></a>Sound<br>
</big></big><br>

Sound support uses the sound capabilities of libsdl which Open Sound
System /dev/dsp device, standard on Linux and available on many other
Unix versions as well. <br>

The Orchestra-85 music synthesis software will run under sdltrs's Model
I emulation, and the Orchestra-90 software will run with Model III
oper- ating systems under sdltrs's Model III, 4, or 4P emulation. For
best results, use Orchestra-90 and the Model 4 emulation, as this lets
the software run at the highest emulated clock rate (4 MHz) and thus
generate the best sound. If you want to run Orchestra-85 instead, you
can tell it that you have a 3.5 MHz clock speedup with enable sequence
3E01D3FE and disable sequence 3E00D3FE; this will let the software run
twice as fast as on an unmodified Model I and generate better sound.
There is no need to use sdltrs's -autodelay flag when running
Orchestra-85/90, but you might want to specify a small fixed delay to
keep from getting excessive key repeat.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Mouse_"></a>Mouse<br>
</big></big><br>

A few Model 4 programs could use a mouse, such as the shareware hi-res
drawing program MDRAW-II. The program XTRSMOUS/CMD on the utility disk
(utility.dsk) is a mouse driver for Model 4/4P mode that should work
with most such programs. sdltrs does not emulate the actual mouse hard-
ware (a serial mouse plugged into the Model 4 RS-232 port), so the
original mouse drivers will not work under sdltrs. Instead, XTRSMOUS
accesses the host mouse pointer using an emulator trap. XTRSMOUS
implements the same TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6 SVC interface as the David Goben
and Matthew Reed mouse drivers. (It does not implement the interface of
the older Scott McBurney mouse driver, which may be required by some
programs.)<br>

<br>

By default XTRSMOUS installs itself in high memory. This is done
because MDRAW-II tests for the presence of a mouse by looking to see
whether the mouse SVC is vectored to high memory. If the driver is
installed in low memory, MDRAW thinks it is not there at all. If you
use mouse-aware programs that don't have this bug, or if you edit the
first line of MDRAW to remove the test, you can install XTRSMOUS in low
memory using the syntax "XTRSMOUS (LOW)".<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Time_of_day_clock_"></a>Time of day clock<br>
</big></big><br>

Several battery-backed time of day clocks were sold for the various
TRS-80 models, including the TimeDate80, TChron1, TRSWatch, and
T-Timer. They are essentially all the same hardware, but reside at a
few different port ranges. sdltrs currently emulates them at port
ranges 0x70-0x7C and 0xB0-0xBC. The T-Timer port range at 0xC0-0xCC
conflicts with the Radio Shack hard drive controller and is not
emulated.<br>

<br>

These clocks return only a 2-digit year, and it is unknown what their
driver software will do in the year 2000 and beyond. If you have
software that works with one of them, please send email to report what
happens when it is used with sdltrs.<br>

<br>

Also see SETTIME/CMD in the "Data import and export" section above for
another way to get the correct time into a Z-80 operating system
running under sdltrs.<br>

<br>

Finally, you might notice that LDOS/LS-DOS always magically knows the
correct date when you boot it (but not the time). When you first power
up the emulated TRS-80, sdltrs dumps the date into the places in memory
where LDOS and LS-DOS normally save it across reboots, so it looks to
the operating system as if you rebooted after setting the date.<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Joystick_"></a>Joystick<br>

Pressing a key on a PC numeric keypad with NumLock disengaged emulates
the Alpha Products joystick. See the Keys section above for details.
The emulated joystick is mapped only at port 0, to avoid conflicts with
other devices. Standard USB joysticks and gamepads will work as well,
and may be selected from the Text GUI (or Preferences on Mac OSX).<br>

&nbsp;This can happen in two ways. &nbsp;First, you can use the
standard Select All shortcut Ctrl-a Cmd-a (or select Select All from the menu on the Mac).
&nbsp;This will select the entire TRS-80 screen, and you will see the
selection rectangle around the edge of the screen. &nbsp;The second
selection method is by clicking and dragging on the main TRS-80 screen,
which will draw the selection rectangle. &nbsp;If you change your mind,
simply click or hit a key, and the selection will be canceled.<br>
<br>
Once
the text is selected, then you can use the standard Ctrl-c or Cmd-c shortcut (or
Copy from the Menu on the Mac). &nbsp;All text mode text will be
copied to the paste buffer. &nbsp;If the selection area is more than
one line high, a line break will be inserted at the end of each line in
the selection rectangle.<br>

sdltrs allows you to save the state of the emulator, so that it may be
loaded later with the Load State command. Location of Disk and cassette
image and inserted into the computer are stored in the state
file.&nbsp; The state is stored in a .t8s file that may be saved using
the Alt-S key combo (Cmd-S or Menu item on the Mac).&nbsp; The Alt-L
key combo will allow you to load a state file that has been saved
(Cmd-L or Menu item on the Mac).<br>

</big></big><br>sdltrs provides optional Disk LED indicators at the
bottom of the emulated screen (on Mac OS X, the indicators are
available as well in the Media Manager).&nbsp; You can turn these off
with the -showled and -hideled options, or through the Text GUI.&nbsp;
The following picture illustrates the LED's:<br>

<br>
The LED's for the 8 floppy drives are on the left bottom of the screen,
and in this case the first drive is active, and the other seven are
not.&nbsp; The LED's for the 4 hard drives are on the right bottom of
the screen, and in this case none of the drives are active.<br>
