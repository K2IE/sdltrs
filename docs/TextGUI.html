<img style="width: 516px; height: 324px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUIMainMenu.png"><br>

<br>
The main menu is the entry point for the Text GUI.&nbsp; You may move
up and down through the menu items using the up and down arrow
keys.&nbsp; A menu item may be selected by pressing Enter when the item
is highlighted.&nbsp; Pressing ESC moves up a menu level (or exits the
GUI if you are at the top level).&nbsp; Besides entering the GUI using
F7, submenus of the GUI may be entered by using the key shortcuts show
on the first three menu items.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><a name="Floppy_Disk_Management_Menu"></a>Floppy Disk Management Menu<br>
</big></big><br>

<img style="width: 515px; height: 326px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUIFloppyMenu.png"><br>

<br>

The floppy disk management menu allows you to insert and remove floppy
images into the emulated drives, as well as save and load disk sets,
create new disk images, and set emulated disk drive options.<br>

<br>

For the first 8 options in the menu, there are three options:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Hitting Enter while the item is selected, will move to the image
selection screen, which is explained below.</li>
  <li>Hitting Backspace will remove a disk image if there is one in the
drive.</li>
  <li>Hitting Space will toggle the write protect for the drive.&nbsp;
The indicator for write protect is an asterisk "*" in front of the
"Disk" in the menu item.</li>
</ul><b>Save Disk Set<u><br> </u></b>
  <br>
This ote, allows the user to save the names of the disk images that are
currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later. &nbsp;The file that
the set is save in has an extension of ".set", and it is a human
readable text file, containing the paths of the image files, or a blank line for a drive for a drive that has no disk.&nbsp; <br>

  <b><br>
Load Disk Set<u><br> </u></b><br>
This
button allows the user to load a disk set saved earlier with the Save
Disk Set Button. &nbsp;The user is allowed to browse for the set file,
displaying files ending in ".set". &nbsp;The emulator then loads the disk
images specified in the file into the corresponding drives. &nbsp;If a drive
in the set file is a blank line, no changes are made to the drive.
&nbsp; This allows the user to load multiple disk sets sequentially. <br>


<br>

<img style="width: 516px; height: 324px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUIFloppyLoad.png"><br>

<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><big><br>
</big></big>
When the user presses Enter in on a Drive item in the Floppy Disk
Management screen, the file open menu is displayed.&nbsp; The up and
down arrows may be used to scroll through the list of files.&nbsp;
Pressing Enter on the &lt;..&gt; item will take you to the parent
directory.&nbsp; On Windows, the Drive letters are listed as the last
items in the menu, and you can change drives by pressing Enter on those
items.&nbsp; You may also go to a particular section of the file list
my pressing the first letter of the file name.<br>

<br>

<img style="width: 516px; height: 325px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUIFlopyCreationMenu.png"><br>

<br>

In the Floppy Creation screen,&nbsp; you
may choose a format of a disk. It may be created in either the JV1,
JV3, or DMK disk image format (See the <a href="Features.html#Emulated_5-inch_floppy_disks">Features</a> page
for info on the disk formats). <br>

<br>

If the "Insert Created Disk Into This Drive" is set to something besides
none, the created image will be mounted on the specified floppy drive.<br>

<br>

<img style="width: 515px; height: 326px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUIFloppyOptionsMenu.png"><br>

<br>

<b>Doubler Type</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Specify what type of double
density adaptor to emulate (Model I
mode only). The type may be percom, radioshack (or tandy), both, or
none. The type may be abbreviated to one character. The default is
both, which causes the double density adaptor emulation to respond to
the special commands of both the Percom and Radio Shack cards.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<b>True DAM Emulation</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Turn off the single density data
address mark remapping kludges
described in the "Emulated floppy disks" and "Real floppy disks"
sections above. With this option given, the distinction between
F8 and FA data address marks is strictly observed on both writing and
reading. This option is probably not useful unless you need to deal
with Model I disks that use the distinction as part of a
copy-protection scheme. See also "Common File Formats for
Emulated TRS-80 Floppy Disks", available at http://www.tim-
<br>

Finally, the last menu item allows you to set the size of each disk
drive, as either a 5" or 8" drive.<br>

The hard disk management menu allows you to insert and remove floppy
images into the emulated drives, as well as save and load disk sets and create new disk images.<br>

<br>

For the first 4 options in the menu, there are three options:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Hitting Enter while the item is selected, will move to the image
selection screen, which is explained above in the floppy disk section.</li>
  <li>Hitting Backspace will remove a disk image if there is one in the

  </li>
</ul>

<b>Save Disk Set<u><br> </u></b>
  <br>

This ote, allows the user to save the names of the disk images that are
currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later. &nbsp;The file that
the set is save in has an extension of ".set", and it is a human
readable text file, containing the paths of the image files, or a blank line for a drive for a drive that has no disk.&nbsp; <br>


  <b><br>

This
button allows the user to load a disk set saved earlier with the Save
Disk Set Button. &nbsp;The user is allowed to browse for the set file,
displaying files ending in ".set". &nbsp;The emulator then loads the disk
images specified in the file into the corresponding drives. &nbsp;If a drive
in the set file is a blank line, no changes are made to the drive.
&nbsp; This allows the user to load multiple disk sets sequentially. <br>

<br>

The cassette management menu allows you to insert and remove cassette
images into the emulated drive, as well as create new cassette images.<br>

<br>

For the first options in the menu, there are two options:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Hitting Enter while the item is selected, will move to the image
selection screen, which is explained above in the floppy disk section.</li>
  <li>Hitting Backspace will remove a cassette image if there is one in
the drive.</li>
</ul>

The second option allows&nbsp; you to set the position of the cassette
tape by changing
the Position field.&nbsp; Valid values are 0 (fully rewound) through
the number of bytes on the tape (at end of tape).<br>

<br>

The final option allows you to create a blank cassette image. <br>

<br>

<img style="width: 516px; height: 325px;" alt="" src="images/TextGUICassetteCreateMenu.png"><br>

<br>

In the Create Cassette Image window,&nbsp; you

The Printer Management menu controls the type of printer emulation that
is used for
outputting to the printer TRS-80. <br>

<br>

The are three choices for printer emulation, None, Text Printer, and
Epson FX-80. &nbsp;The Text printer simply sends the printer
output to a text file with optional script processing.&nbsp; The Epson
option is only available on the Macintosh, and it emulates a legacy
printer, and allow the user to save the
printer output in a PDF file.<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>

</span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>The only option for the text printer type is&nbsp;the command
used to print.
&nbsp;Within the command, %s is used to represent the file name of the
temporary file generated during printing.&nbsp; On Linux, this
defaults to "lpr %s", on Windows "notepad %s", and on the Mac "open
%s".&nbsp; The %s in the printer command will be replaced with the name
of the printer output file.&nbsp; (On the Mac, this is for the text
printer only, not the Epson emulation). <br>

foreground and white (0xFFFFFF) for background.&nbsp; <br>

<b><br>
</b><b>Character Sets</b><br>

<br>

Select among several sets of
built-in character bitmaps.&nbsp; The three different options allow you
to specify the character set used for each model, should you change
models during sdltrs execution using the GUI. &nbsp; In Model I mode ,
five sets are available.
The default, wider, is a modified Model III set with characters 8
pixels wide; it looks better on a modern computer screen with square
pixels than the real Model I fonts, which were 6 pixels wide. lcmod is
the character set in the replacement character generator that was
supplied with the Radio Shack lower case modification. (It was
reconstructed partly from memory and may have some minor bit errors.)
stock is the character set in the stock character generator supplied
with most upper case only machines. Since sdltrs currently always
emulates the extra bit of display memory needed to support lower case,
this character set gives you the authentic, unpleasant effect that real
Model I users
saw when they tried to do homebrew lower case modifications without
replacing the character generator: lower case letters appear at an
inconsistent height, and if you are using the Level II BASIC ROM
display driver, upper case letters are replaced by meaningless symbols.
early is the same as stock, but with the standard ASCII
characters [, \, ], and ^ in the positions where most Model I's
had directional arrows. This was the default programming in the
Motorola character generator ROM that Radio Shack used, and a
few early machines were actually shipped with this ROM.
Finally, german or genie gives an approximate emulation of the
GENIE, a German Model I clone. Characters are 8
pixels wide, and double width is supported even though later GENIE
models did not include it.<br>

<br>

In Model III , 4 and 4P ( modes, three sets are
available:<br>

katakana (the default for Model III) is the original Model III
set with Japanese Katakana characters in the alternate character
positions. This set was also used in early Model 4's. international
(the default for Model 4 and 4P) is a later Model 4
set with accented Roman letters in the alternate positions.<br>

bold is a bold set from a character generator ROM found in
one Model III, origin uncertain.<br>

<br>

<b>Window Border Width:</b> <br>

<br>

Put a border of width pixels
around the TRS-80 display. The default is 2.&nbsp; <br>

<b><br>
Resize Window on Model 3 Mode Change:</b> <br>

<br>

In Model 3&nbsp; mode,
resize the&nbsp; window whenever the emulated display mode changes
between
64x16 text (or 512x192 graphics) and 80x24 text (or 640x240
graphics).&nbsp; <br>

<br>

<b>Shift Bracket Emulation</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Chose Shift Bracket Emulation on or off.&nbsp; If on, emulate [, \, ],
^, and _ as
shifted keys, and {, |, }, and ~ as
unshifted. This is the default in Model 4 and 4P modes, and it
works well with the keyboard driver in Model 4 TRSDOS/LS-DOS 6. If off,
emulate [, \, ], ^, and _ as
unshifted keys, and {, |, }, and ~
as shifted. This is the default in Model I and III modes, and
it works well with many TRS-80 keyboard drivers. With some keyboard
drivers these keys do not work at all, however. <br>

<b><br>
Turbo Mode/b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

This will turn Turbo mode on or off.  When turbo mode is on, the emulator will run
faster than a normal TRS80, by a factor of Turbo Rate, which is explained below, and also set
on this page.  The F11 key may be used to switch Turbo mode on or off while running the emulator.

<br>

<b><br>
Turbo Speed</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Set the number of times normal TRS80 speed that the emulator runs when in 
"Turbo" mode.  Turbo mode can be used to speed compute intensive applications,
compiling source code for example, on the emulator.  The default setting is 5x.
Above around 8x you may experience problems with runaway keyboard repeat on the
emulator, so use higher values with caution. <br>

<br>

<b><br>
Keystretch Value</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Fine-tune the keyboard behavior.
To prevent keystrokes from being lost, sdltrs "stretches" the intervals
between key transitions, so that the Z-80 program has time to see each
transition before the next one occurs. Whenever the Z-80 program reads
the keyboard matrix and sees an emulated key go up or down, sdltrs
waits cycles Z-80 clock cycles (T-states) before it allows the program
to see another key transition. Key transitions that are received during
the waiting period or when the Z-80 program
is not reading the keyboard are held in a queue. The default stretch
value is 4000 cycles; it should seldom if ever be necessary to change
it. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Emtsafe</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span></span>
Turn on/off ability for emts (Emulation traps) to write to unexpected
places in the host filesystem.<br>

<br>

<b>Serial Port Switches</b><b>:</b> <br>

<br>

Set the sense switches on the
Model I serial port card. This
option is meaningful only in Model I mode, and only when the Serial
Port Name is not set to "". The default value is 0x6f,
which Radio Shack software conventionally interprets as 9600 bps, 8
bits/word, no parity, 1 stop bit.<br>

<b><br>
Serial Port Name</b><b>:</b> <br>

Set the tty device to be used
for I/O to the TRS-80's serial
port. The default is "".
Setting the name to be empty&nbsp; emulates
having no serial port.&nbsp; <br>
